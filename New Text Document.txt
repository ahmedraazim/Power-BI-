I used Power BI to analyze the student enrollment data for ABC Institute across the years 2021 to 2023. By importing data from various sources, including Excel files and text documents, I created interactive dashboards that provide insights into key metrics such as the number of students enrolled in different courses, revenue generated from each course, and trends in enrollment over time. The analysis allows us to quickly identify popular courses, track revenue growth, and observe seasonal patterns in enrollment. Additionally, I used Power BIâ€™s data visualization capabilities to highlight trends in student demographics, enabling the institution to make data-driven decisions for future course offerings and marketing strategies. This comprehensive analysis not only offers a clear view of past performance but also supports strategic planning to enhance student engagement and optimize course offerings.
